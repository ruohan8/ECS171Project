# ECS171_Project

changes made:  
- one hot encoding now one hot encodes each dataset
- the country_data dictionary's value attribute splits the input (dataset) and output (salary)
- pca is implemented instead of the correlation matrix, I can try to implement the correlation matrix later
- eda now shows a histogram and boxplot for every country
